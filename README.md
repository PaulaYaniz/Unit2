# Unit 2: A Distributed Weather Station for ISAK


# Criteria A: Planning


## Problem definition
Emile and Ainne are two resource-limited roommates at UWC ISAK Japan worried about their health, as they’ve seen on a tiktok that the the temperature and humidity in their room can cause health issues. They’ve started leaving a thermometer so that they can see the temperature of the room and check it once a day before going to sleep, but the task has become tedious and inaccurate since they often forget to check it and it's very restricted to their room, which means they don’t know the value of this data relative to the temperature and humidity of the campus. It is also difficult to compare the data they get from the thermometer, and they have no way to measure humidity. Ainne and Emile are in need of a cost effective, more efficient way to get and visualize both the humidity and temperature of their room and the campus along with other useful measures of the data such as mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and median.



## Proposed Solution
Considering the client requirements an adequate solution includes a low cost sensing device for humidity and temperature and a custom data script that process and anaysis the samples acquired. For a low cost sensing device an adequate alternative is the DHT11 sensor[^1] which is offered online for less than 5 USD and provides adequare precision and range for the client requirements (Temperature Range: 0°C to 50°C, Humidity Range: 20% to 90%). Similar devices such as the DHT22, AHT20 or the AM2301B [^2] have higher specifications, however the DHT11 uses a simple serial communication (SPI) rather than more eleborated protocols such as the I2C used by the alternatives. For the range, precision and accuracy required in this applicaiton the DHT11 provides the best compromise. Connecting the DHT11 sensor to a computer requires a device that provides a Serial Port communication. A cheap and often used alternative for prototyping is the Arduino UNO microcontroller [^3]. "Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software"[^4]. In additon to the low cost of the Arduino (< 6USD), this devide is programable and expandable[^1]. Other alternatives include diffeerent versions of the original Arduino but their size and price make them a less adequate solution.


**Design statement**

I will design and make a program that checks temperature and humidity for two clients who are roommates and students at UWC ISAK Japan. The program will consist on a tool called DHT11 sensor for being able to keep track of humidity and temperature of their rooms, plus getting useful measures such as mean, standard deviaton, minimum, maximum, and median. It is constructed using the softwares Python, Arduino, and DHT11. It will take 3 weeks to make and will be evaluated according to the criteria A, B, and C.

## Success Criteria

1. The solution provides a visual representation of the Humidity and Temperature values inside a dormitory (Local) and outside the house (Remote) for a period of minimum 48 hours. 
2. ```[HL]``` The local variables will be measure using a set of 4 sensors around the dormitory.
3. The solution provides a mathematical modelling for the Humidity and Temperature levels for each Local and Remote locations. ```(SL: linear model)```, ```(HL: non-lineal model)```
4. The solution provides a comparative analysis for the Humidity and Temperature levels for each Local and Remote locations including mean, standad deviation, minimum, maximum, and median.
5. ```(SL)```The Local samples are stored in a csv file and ```(HL)``` posted to the remote server.
6. Create a prediction the subsequent 12 hours for both temperature and humidity.
7. A poster summarizing the visual representations, model and analysis is created and communicated. (Should include a study of health levels)

# Criteria B: Design

**Fig.1** shows the system diagram for the proposed solution (**SL**). The indoor variables will be measured using an Arduino microprocessor and the sensor DHT11 conencted to the local computer (Laptop) located inside a room. The outdoor variables will be requested to the remote server using a GET request to the API of the server at ```192.168.6.147/readings```. The local values are stored in a CSV database locally.

### Arduino data recollection
Our clients Ainée and Emile need a cheap and effecive way to recollect data for atleast 48 hrs and collect that data into two spereate cvs files where the the date in which it was taken is also saved. This is in orde to contribute to the a cost effective, more efficient way to get and visualize both the humidity and temperature of their room and the campus along with other useful measures of the data such as mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and median. Something that was very significant for the development of all parts was the proper formating and recollenction of our data in csv files


```.py
from datetime import datetime

import serial
import time
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt


arduino = serial.Serial(port='/dev/cu.usbserial-110', baudrate=9600, timeout=.1)


def read():
    data = ""
    while len(data) < 1:
        data = arduino.readline()
    return data


while True:
    time.sleep(300)
    value = read() #wait until data is in the port
    msg = value.decode('utf-8')
    if not "Hello" in msg:
        hum, temp = msg.split(" ")
        temp = temp.split(":")[1][0:-3]
        temp += "\n"
        hum = hum.split(":")[1][0:-1]

        print("temp", temp)
        print("hum", hum)

        with open('temperature.csv', 'a') as file:
            file.write(f"{temp},{datetime.now()}")

        with open('humidity.csv', 'a') as file:
            file.write(f"{hum},{datetime.now()}")
            file.write("\n")
```

### R3-12 Mathematical Models and Graphing
Our clients Ainée and Emile, require mathematical models, to better understand the data they have collected. For this section of the project we have decided to create figuures in which the graphs are shown as plot s and then as scatter with the quadratic and linear models, that way the clients can see their data through both models while still comparing it to the raw graphs that are above on the figure. The figure and subplots is a great way to format our graphs, awell as the quadratic and linear models, becuase they are clear and easy to read which will contribute to the effectiveness of our solution for the problem

## Comparative analysis

For this part we've used the skills that we have learned during class and identified some relevant values using the succes criteria and in addition other relevant data. Some of this values are the minimum, the maximum, the mean deviation, the median. We've collected this values for bot the sensor data and the R3-12 room E data.
