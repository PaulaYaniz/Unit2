# Unit 1 Reflection
### What worked well during unit 1?
During unit 1 I felt organized, so everyrhing in general worked well for me. When I knew I had a due date I did the tasks, quizzes and homework.
### What did not work well?
Sometimes I did not know the due date of a task or homework, and that made me do them fast and not as good as I wanted to. I also had a lot of difficulties with flow diagrams, but after some practice I started making them better.
### What did you enjoy the most during project unit 1?
I really liked the project because we had freedom to create a personalised project with all the features we wanted to add. Also, the topic interested me and it allowed me to do research about cryptocurrencies and online cryptowallets.
### What talent have you discovered or practiced during this unit?
Thanks to the project I discovered that Python has a lot of possibilites and you can create a lot of types of programs with it. I learned that the most important thing is to start small and simple and then develop the project with more complex features.
### What is working well in Computer Science for you?
Keeping my GitHub organized with all the quizzes and tasks in folders.
### What can Dr Ruben do better to support you during Unit 2?
I would like to know all the due dates for sending taks and quizzes with more advance, so I can organize myself.
