## 27. Create a errorbar graph for the data below. You will need to calculate the mean and standard deviation first.
sensorA = [16, 24, 24, 9, 23, 26, 26, 23, 25, 14]  
sensorB = [2, 19, 25, 10, 11, 24, 17, 7, 24, 17]  
sensorC = [15, 11, 24, 21, 6, 2, 18, 27, 1, 16]  

```.py
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

sensorA = [16, 24, 24, 9, 23, 26, 26, 23, 25, 14]
sensorB = [2, 19, 25, 10, 11, 24, 17, 7, 24, 17]
sensorC = [15, 11, 24, 21, 6, 2, 18, 27, 1, 16]

samples = []
for i in range(len(sensorA)):
    samples.append(i)

mean = []
standard_dev = []
for i in range(len(sensorA)):
    data = [sensorA[i], sensorB[i], sensorC[i]]
    mean.append(np.mean(data))
    standard_dev.append(np.std(data))

plt.plot(samples, mean)
plt.errorbar(samples, mean, standard_dev, fmt="o")
plt.show()

```
